In An Apology in Bloom, wedding florist Jaime Harper is on a meteoric rise, working for an event company led by a successful and way-too-handsome boss. When a letter arrives from her past mentor with an offer too good to pass up, will she stay or head back to her hometown? In A Bouquet of Dreams, Claire Murphy has always dreamed of owning a flower shop, and when her employers hint at retirement, she believes her moment has arrived. But first she must confront her past--and the man who caused her to flee her hometown years ago. In A Field of Beauty, Tessa Anderson has found an acre of farmland to start her flower farm and forget the past. She's grateful for the help of two men--her boyfriend, Tyler, and a quiet soil specialist named Dawson. But as the farm finally starts to bloom, Tessa will discover something that challenges everything she's built. In A Future in Blossom, Jaime, Claire, and Tessa return to their hometown, finally ready to face each other and their beloved mentor, flower shop owner Rose Reid. As they unite to pull off an extraordinary wedding, amid the flurry of preparations they just may find their way to forgiveness.",

        "description": "As a child, Bríd Kennedy was fascinated with the beautiful scents, colors, and shapes of flowers. They stirred something deep within that she could not name. The mystery and beauty of flowers sparked her curiosity to develop her research question: Is flower appreciation a participation in a Divine-human transformation process, and if so, how is it being expressed? Through a practice of authentic interiority striving towards beauty, intelligibility, truth, goodness, and love, the author now realizes how interdependent humans are with all creation. Flowers are an essential part of creation bringing in wisdom and healing. Appreciating them is a participation in a Divine-human transformation process expressed through our acknowledgement of the scent, color, shape, and any changes in these through deeply knowing that something sacred is within them. Taking precious moments to stand and smell flowers enriches the soul as it reminds people of who they are as humans and to care for Mother Earth. Drawing on science, spirituality studies, psycho-spiritual perspectives, and historical and cultural literature awakened Kennedy’s appreciation of “beauty within.” Flowers are evidence of the purpose in the universe. Consider and contemplate them in depth, as this book invites and initiates. The well-being of one’s body is not possible without the well-being of the planet.",

        "description": "As a child, Bríd Kennedy was fascinated with the beautiful scents, colors, and shapes of flowers. They stirred something deep within that she could not name. The mystery and beauty of flowers sparked her curiosity to develop her research question: Is flower appreciation a participation in a Divine-human transformation process, and if so, how is it being expressed? Through a practice of authentic interiority striving towards beauty, intelligibility, truth, goodness, and love, the author now realizes how interdependent humans are with all creation. Flowers are an essential part of creation bringing in wisdom and healing. Appreciating them is a participation in a Divine-human transformation process expressed through our acknowledgement of the scent, color, shape, and any changes in these through deeply knowing that something sacred is within them. Taking precious moments to stand and smell flowers enriches the soul as it reminds people of who they are as humans and to care for Mother Earth. Drawing on science, spirituality studies, psycho-spiritual perspectives, and historical and cultural literature awakened Kennedy’s appreciation of “beauty within.” Flowers are evidence of the purpose in the universe. Consider and contemplate them in depth, as this book invites and initiates. The well-being of one’s body is not possible without the well-being of the planet.",
